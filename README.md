<!--              <p><b>Pencil2D</b> is great for those that want to experience 2d hand-drawn animations and great for those just entered the field of animations with it not having so many robust features that may confuse you and it being free to use.<br><br>-->
<!--              For your stylus pen any affordable one will most likely work but we mainly recommend <b>Adonit Dash 2</b> a pen that is affordable but with the downside of not having some of the features a more expensive pen would, still a great stylus pen for those wishing to test the waters with animations in general.<br><br>-->
<!--              Now lastly for beginners is the trusty device you will be sketching out all your animations on. We would recommend you to use any device you own to start out with as to not spend any on something that might later just turn into a hobby. As long as that device is compatible with such animation software and pen you will be good to go, but mainly you would look for a tablet when you want to animate. -->
