              <p>Animation had gone through a drastic change throughout the courses of time. Starting out as simply hand drawn images, to now with much smoother animations with the assistance of technology but also as people continue to refine the skill, and maybe in the future where AI can essentially become an animator themselves.<br><br> As for introducing animations, the easiest way to describe animation would be many individual drawings put together to create the illusion of movement. Such movements could range from simply a single character walking, slight hand movements and such to complex movements such as full on dancing, and animating multiple character movements in backgrounds. There are also many types of styles for animations, ranging from 2D, 3D, to stop motion animation and so much more. This website would mainly focus on the 2D animations but it might include other types of animation styles throughout.
